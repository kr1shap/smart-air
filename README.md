# SMART AIR 

SmartAir is a kid-friendly Android application designed to help children ages **6–16** understand and manage their asthma, while giving parents the tools to track medicine use, symptoms, PEF zones, and safety alerts. Parents can selectively share their child’s data with healthcare providers through a **consise, exportable PDF/CSV report**.

SmartAir combines education, monitoring and emergency guidance into one simple platform.
